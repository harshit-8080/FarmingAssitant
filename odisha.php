   <h1>Overview</h1>
    <p>
      Agriculture in Odisha is the mainstay of majority of the populace and thus, holds the key
      to socio-economic development of the State. It suffers from frequent natural calamities like
      cyclones, drought and flash floods. The share of Agriculture Sector in the State’s GSDP has
      been declining over the years. The share of this Sector in Odisha’s GSDP is expected to be 15.6
      percent in 2013-14 as per advance estimates. Despite wide annual variations in its growth,
      the agriculture sector grew in real terms at 2004-05 prices, at a rate of 12.72 percent during
      2012-13. However, a negative growth of 3.53 percent is anticipated during 2013-14 due to
      cyclonic storm ‘Phailin’ and fl ash fl oods in the State in October 2013. This Sector still provides
      employment to more than 60% of the population directly or indirectly, making it the largest
      employment sector of the state. Hence, development in agriculture sector is vital to set the
      pace of development in the state.

    <h1>Major Crops</h1>
    <h2 style="color: blue">Rice</h2>
    <p>
      Rice is the principal food crop in the state occupying about 40.27 lakh ha annually
      (37.48 lakh ha. during Kharif season + 2.79 lakh ha. during Rabi season). The Kharif Paddy
      area consists of 6.06 lakh ha of high land 16.51 lakh ha of medium land and 14.91 lakh ha of
      low land. The entire Rabi area is irrigated & covered by HYV Paddy where as 42% of Kharif
      Paddy area is covered under irrigation. The yield rate of rice is 2.44 tonnes/ ha as against
      national average of 2.46 tonnes / ha.
    </p>
     <h2 style="color: blue">Pulses</h2> 
     <p>
       Arhar, Mung, Biri, Kulthi, Gram, Fieldpea, Cowpea, Lentil are the pulse crops grown
      in the State. The major crops are Arhar, Mung, Biri and Kulthi. Pulses are grown mainly in
      uplands during Kharif season predominantly in inland districts & in rice fallows during Rabi
      season, mostly in coastal districts under available moisture condition. Mung & Biri are also
      grown as third crop in summer under irrigated condition. Post monsoon rains, mostly govern
      the Rabi coverage of pulses in rice fallows.

    <h1>Irrigation</h1>
    <p>
      Out of the cultivated area of 61.80 lakh ha, about 54% is under irrigated conditions and
      46% is under un-irrigated during Kharif. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The irrigation potential created from all sources till Kharif’2013 is 39.39 lakh ha &
      in Rabi’2013-14 is 16.52 lakh ha. The gross irrigated cropped area is 35.21 lakh ha, which
      is about 70.5% of the potential created. There is a constant endeavour to enhance the
      water use effi ciency through adoption of proper water management practices in addition to
      appropriate irrigation devices.

    <h1>Climate & Rainfall</h1>
    <p> 
      State’s climate is tropical, characterized by high temperature, high humidity, medium
      to high rainfall and short and mild winters. The normal rainfall of the State is 1451.2 mm. 
    </p>
    <img src="http://www.osdma.org//ckeditor/CKImages/13-Oct-2018Rainfall%20Dist_13.10.18.jpg" class="pic">
    <p>
      The actual rainfall received, vary from district to district. About 84% of rainfall is
      received during the period from June to September. Even though the quantum of rainfall is
      quite high, its distribution during the monsoon period is highly uneven and erratic. Flood,
      drought and cyclone visit regularly with varying intensity. Due to frequent occurrence of 
      3
      these natural calamities there is always reduction in the yield of Kharif rice, the major crop
      of the State. Similarly, in drought years, there is considerable loss in production of Pulses
      and Oilseeds both during Kharif and Rabi.
