<h3>What is Organic Farming?</h3>
<div>
      	<p>Organic farming system in India is not new and is being followed from ancient time. It is a method of farming system which primarily aimed at cultivating the land and raising crops in such a way, as to keep the soil alive and in good health by use of organic wastes (crop, animal and farm wastes, aquatic wastes) and other biological materials along with beneficial microbes (biofertilizers) to release nutrients to crops for increased sustainable production in an eco friendly pollution free environment.

As per the definition of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) study team on organic farming “organic farming is a system which avoids or largely excludes the use of synthetic inputs (such as fertilizers, pesticides, hormones, feed additives etc) and to the maximum extent feasible rely upon crop rotations, crop residues, animal manures, off-farm organic waste, mineral grade rock additives and biological system of nutrient mobilization and plant protection”.

FAO suggested that “Organic agriculture is a unique production management system which promotes and enhances agro-ecosystem health, including biodiversity, biological cycles and soil biological activity, and this is accomplished by using on-farm agronomic, biological and mechanical methods in exclusion of all synthetic off-farm inputs”.

      <h3>Need Of Organic Farming</h3>
<div>
        <p>With the increase in population our compulsion would be not only to stabilize agricultural production but to increase it further in sustainable manner. The scientists have realized that the ‘Green Revolution’ with high input use has reached a plateau and is now sustained with diminishing return of falling dividends. Thus, a natural balance needs to be maintained at all cost for existence of life and property. The obvious choice for that would be more relevant in the present era, when these agrochemicals which are produced from fossil fuel and are not renewable and are diminishing in availability. It may also cost heavily on our foreign exchange in future.

<h3>The key characteristics of organic farming include</h3>
<div>
          <ul class="list">
            <li>Protecting the long term fertility of soils by maintaining organic matter levels, encouraging soil biological activity, and careful mechanical intervention.</li>
            <li>Providing crop nutrients indirectly using relatively insoluble nutrient sources which are made available to the plant by the action of soil micro-organisms</li>
            <li>Nitrogen self-sufficiency through the use of legumes and biological nitrogen fixation, as well as effective recycling of organic materials including crop residues and livestock manures.</li>
            <li>Weed, disease and pest control relying primarily on crop rotations, natural predators, diversity, organic manuring, resistant varieties and limited (preferably minimal) thermal, biological and chemical intervention.</li>
            <li>The extensive management of livestock, paying full regard to their evolutionary adaptations, behavioural needs and animal welfare issues with respect to nutrition, housing, health, breeding and rearing.</li>
            <li>Careful attention to the impact of the farming system on the wider environment and the conservation of wildlife and natural habitats.</li>
          </ul>
</div>
 <h3>Benefits Of Organic Farming</h3>
<div>
      <h2>01  Reduced Exposure to Pesticides and Chemicals</h2>
       <p>Pesticide and chemical use results in many negative environmental issues:
       </p>
        <img src="https://www.thebalancesmb.com/thmb/GnXJVU0lvNUSgs17FepXqQCuCf8=/950x0/filters:format(webp)/GettyImages-539114014-5892d7b93df78caebc2aef37.jpg" class="pic" />
<ul class="list">
  <li>Pesticides allow disease resistance to build up in plants, weeds, plant-eating-insects, fungi, and bacteria.</li>
  <li>Pesticides and chemicals sprayed on plants contaminate the soil, water supply, and air. Sometimes these harmful pesticides stick around for decades (maybe longer).</li>
  <li>Synthetic chemicals also discourage smart farming practices such as cover crops and crop rotation, which in turn, may cause other harmful environmental problems like erosion.</li>
</ul>
<h2>02  Organic Farming Builds Healthy Soil</h2>
       <p>To grow healthy food, you must start with healthy soil. If you treat the soil with harmful pesticides and chemicals, you may end up with soil that cannot thrive on its own.
       </p>
        <img src="https://www.thebalancesmb.com/thmb/Blw3VT8-AaDW8JsC804omLa29io=/950x0/filters:format(webp)/GettyImages-500274833-587cda1a5f9b584db3fe1d6d.jpg" class="pic" />
        <p>
        Natural cultivation practices are far better than chemical soil management.
A large nine-year study by USDA Agricultural Research Service (ARS), shows that organic farming builds up organic soil matter better than conventional no-till farming..
</p>
<h2>03  Combatting Erosion</h2>
       <p>Not only does organic farming build healthy soil, but it helps combat serious soil and land issues, such as erosion.
       </p>
       <img src="https://www.thebalancesmb.com/thmb/K8moyR77Mai2WHL7Qm-6u3VSkDg=/950x0/filters:format(webp)/cover_crops_NRCS_oregon-56a4aa205f9b58b7d0d8231b.jpg" class="pic" />
       <p>
A major study comparing adjoining organic and chemically treated wheat fields showed that the organic field featured eight more inches of topsoil than the chemically treated field and also had only one-third the erosion loss.
If you aren't concerned about erosion; you should be. Erosion issues are extremely serious, affecting the land, food supply, and humans. However, organic farming practices do help discourage erosion from occurring.
</p>
<h2>04  Organic Farming Encourages Biodiversity</h2>
       <p>
        In general, the more biodiversity there is on a farm, the more stable the farm is.
      </p>
      <img src="https://www.fibl.org/fileadmin/_processed_/2/2/csm_pfiffner_feuerfalter_21d7f4dd02.jpg" class="pic" />
      <p >
         Organic farming encourages healthy biodiversity, which plays a critical role in how resilient, or not, a farm is to issues like bad weather, disease, and pests.
Additionally, reduced biodiversity may directly correlate with a rise in infectious diseases, which of course, isn't good for people or the planet.
</p>
<h2>05  Supporting Animal Health and Welfare</h2>
       <p>
        Insects, birds, fish and all sorts of other critters experience problems when humans swoop in and destroy their natural habitat.</p>
     <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/EarthwatchMedia/GalleryImages/rossi-h8_6972.jpg" class="pic">
 <p>    
Organic farming not only helps preserve more natural habitat areas but also encourages birds and other natural predators to live happily on farmland, which assists in natural pest control.
Additionally, animals who live on organic farms are exposed to clean, chemical-free grazing that helps keep them naturally healthy and resistant to illness. As a perk for organic farmers, happy and healthy organic animals are productive organic animals.​
