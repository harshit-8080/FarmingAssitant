      	<p style="margin-left: 250px;font-size: 20px;margin-right: 250px">A sickle is a hand-held agricultural tool with a variously curved blade typically used for harvesting grain crops or cutting succulent forage chiefly for feeding livestock (either freshly cut or dried as hay). A great diversity of types is used across many cultures. Between the dawn of the Iron Age and present, hundreds of region-specific variants of this basic forage-cutting tool were forged of iron, later steel.</p>

      	<p style="margin-left: 250px;font-size: 20px;margin-right: 250px">A hoe is an ancient and versatile agricultural hand tool used to shape the soil, control weeds, clear soil, and harvest root crops. Shaping the soil can be piling soil around the base of plants (hilling), creating narrow furrows (drills) and shallow trenches for planting seeds and bulbs. Weed control with a hoe can be by agitating the surface of the soil or by cutting foliage from the roots, and clearing soil of old roots and crop residues. Hoes for digging and moving soil are used harvesting root crops such as potatoes.</p>

      	<p style="margin-left: 250px;font-size: 20px;margin-right: 250px">A pickaxe or pick is a hand tool with a hard head attached perpendicular to the handle. They are used as tools for landscaping, breaking up hard surfaces and as farming implements. It consists of a handle and a head made of metal that has both a pointed and blunt end. The pointed end breaks up hard surfaces, while the blunt end can be used to pry things up. A pickaxe can often break up soils that a shovel canâ€™t. Dry, hardened clay or rocky soils can be broken up using the sharp end of the axe.</p>

        <p style="margin-left: 250px;font-size: 20px;margin-right: 250px">A transplanting garden trowel can be used for moving a plant from one location to another, for example from a greenhouse and into the garden. This helps to protect young plants from any pests or frost in the greenhouse until they are old enough to withstand them.eeding garden trowels are used to remove weeds from a garden without causing too much damage to any surrounding plants. This is due to their blades having a forked end which allows them to dig to the base of a weed and pull it out by its roots./p>
