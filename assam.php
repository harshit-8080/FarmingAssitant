<p style="font-size: 50px;margin-left: 30px;">Introduction</p>
<div id="d1"   style="font-size:20px">Agriculture in Assam accounts for about 54.11 per cent of the total geographical area of the state, with almost 70% of the population directly dependent on agriculture as an income source. It is an integral revenue earning sector of the state, sustaining a huge number of people.
Owing to the availability of fertile soil and abundance of rain, the state provides a favourable environment of production of both food and cash crops such as rice, pulses, tea etc. Since the economy of Assam is primarily dependent on agriculture, the Agriculture Department of Assam is striving to practise a sustainable, cost-effective and scientifically advanced form of agriculture through implementation of various policies and initiatives.
Initially, the Agriculture Department in the state was created in April, 1882. But later on in 1923, three allied Department of Agriculture, Cooperation and Industries were combined. At present, the Department of Agriculture is driven by the vision to implement policies and programmes aimed at achieving rapid agricultural growth through optimum utilization of available resources of the State. It aims to educate the farmers in practising sustainable and commercial modes of agriculture, with the use of scientific methods. Besides popularizing the use of farmer's friendly bio-fertilizers, it gives utmost emphasis on creation of assured irrigation facilities to the farmers through minor irrigation schemes to obtain maximum returns from their land. The Department also conducts various programmes from time to time to enlighten the farmers on the use of ICT applications and calamity relief programmes during natural disasters.</div>
<p style ="font-size: 50px;margin-left: 30px;">Important agriculture crops of Assam</p>
<div id="d1" style="font-size: 20px"> Assam produces both food and cash crops. The principal food crops produced in the state are rice (paddy), maize (corn), pulses, potato, wheat, etc., while the principal cash crops are tea, jute, oilseeds, sugarcane, cotton, and tobacco.
 <h2 style="margin-left: 30px;"> Some of the important crops that are grown in abundance in the state are:

	<li> maize..</li>
	<li> pulses..</li>
	<li> potatoes..</li>
</ul>
<p style="font-size: 20px"> The agriculture in Assam also comprise of production of few endemic vegetables such as  potatoes, sweet potatoes, ginger, cili pepperand turmeric etc... 
</p>
<p style="font-size: 20px">  The fruits that are cultivated include Banana, pine apple, assam lemon,oranges, guava,lychees etc...

 <p style ="font-size: 50px;margin-left: 30px;">Assam soil and vegetation</p>
 <div id="d1" style="font-size: 20px">Soil is the most valuable nature resource and serves as one of the prime requisite of life. Soils and in its turn the land through their relative fertility support all agricultural activity ant the plant growth and thereby the most important element of the natural ecosystem. As regards the soils of Assam, geology (parent material), topography and climate seem to play vital role in their formations. Therefore, under varying geological conditions, topographical characteristics and agro-climatic situations different types of soils are found to occur in the hills, piedmonts, plateaus and plains. The soils of Assam may thus generally be divided into four groups, viz.
 	<ul style="font-size: 20px"> 
 		<li> Alluvial soil</li>
 		<li> piedmont soil</li>
 		<li> Hill soil</li>
 		<li> lateritic soil etc.</li>
 	</ul>
 	<h2 style="margin-left: 30px;"> The wide range of cash crops that the state grows are:</h2>
 	<ul style="font-size: 20px"> 
 		<li> jute</li>
 		<li> sugarcane</li>
 		<li> coconut</li>
 		<li> fruits</li>
 		<li> pulses</li>
 	</ul>
 <h2 style="margin-left: 30px;"> The state of Assam is also the producer of fine varieties of the following fruits:</h2>
 <ul style="font-size: 20px"> 
 	<li> PineApple</li>
 	<li> Orange</li>
 	<li> Assam lemon</li>
 	<li> Guava</li>
 	<li> Lychees</li>
 	<li> jack fruit</li>
 </ul>
 <p style ="font-size:20px;">Assam is known for its extensive forest areas and availability of rich floras and faunas besides other valuable forest products. As per information available from the State Forest Department, the total area under forests in Assam was 26,781.91 Sq.km. at the end of March, 2003, out of which 15,492.329 Sq. Km. was under Reserved Forests and 2,860.942 Sq. Km. under Protected Forest Area. But this rich forest cover and valuable forest resources of the state are disappearing rapidly particularly from the last few decades due to massive deforestation, illegal felling, forest fragmentation, encroachment in the fringe areas, poaching, biopiracy and other unplanned development activities.

<p style ="font-size: 50px;margin-left: 30px;">Climate of Assam</p>
<div id="d1" style="font-size: 20px">With the "Tropical Monsoon Rainforest Climate", Assam is temperate (summer max. at 95–100 °F or 35–38 °C and winter min. at 43–46 °F or 6–8 °C) and experiences heavy rainfall and high humidity.[55][58] The climate is characterised by heavy monsoon downpours reducing summer temperatures and affecting foggy nights and mornings in winters, frequent during the afternoons. Spring (Mar–Apr) and autumn (Sept–Oct) are usually pleasant with moderate rainfall and temperature. Assam's agriculture usually depends on the south-west monsoon rains.</div>
