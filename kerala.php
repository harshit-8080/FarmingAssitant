Paddy cultivation is the part and parcel of our culture and it is the State's major food crop.

The State has witnessed a remarkable transformation in the agricultural sector since its formation. The implementation of Land Reforms Act in 1963 became the knell of feudalism and it became the landmark in the Kerala's agricultural sector and a stepping-stone for further reforms in this field.

The production has also concomitantly declined from 13.76 lakh MT in 1972-73 (peak of production) to 5.49 lakh MT in 2015-16 (Appendix 2.4). Moreover, the productivity of the crop is very low in the State (2790 kg/ha), though it is higher than the national average (2424 kg/ha).
