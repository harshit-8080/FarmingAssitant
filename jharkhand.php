	Jharkhand farming analysis
</h1><hr>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<div id="shyam">

<p>
	Agriculture is the main stay for the 80% of rural population of the state. Agriculture is their employment and primary income generating activity. The agricultural economy of the Jharkhand state is characterized by dependence on nature, low investment ,low productivity, mono-croping with paddy as the dominant crop , in inadequate irrigation facilities and small ands marginal holdings. The dependence of agriculture on the Vagaries of the rain-god can be gauged from the fact that as much as 92% of the total cultivated area is unirrigated.

The cultivable land resources of the state has good potential for higher production of horticulture and forest products. The soil is young and has high capacity of fixation of humus. The forest provides sufficient biomass to feed its soiling. However, Soil erosion and failure to recycle the biomass is depleting the soil fertility. Hence , a judicious oil ,water and land management is required only that can improve agriculture productivity. Despite the fact that the state has a good rainfall , the surface water availability to agriculture is not sufficient due to inadequate storage facilities etc. as far as the status of ground water is concerned , it is also in the poor state due to little recharging of ground water by natural process in absence of artificial recharging facilities, as a result , the water label in the plateau is going down.</p>

<p>
Presently, The availability of water resource is only 287810 lakhs m3, out of which 237890 lakh .m3 is from surface water and rest 49920 lakh m3 is from ground water. The total utilization of surface and ground water in the state for irrigation purposes so far is only 47360 lakh m3 out of which 39640 lakh m3 is surface water and 7720 lakh m3 is ground water. For all round agricultural development, technology must be supplemented by institutional mechanisms to ensure the provision of the essential facilities and services that the farmers need to improve agronomic practices and obtain higher yield. Only the development of a healthy agricultural marketing system can guarantee remunerative prices to the farmers and motivate the adoption of scientific cultivation for raising agricultural productivity.

<h2>
	Important Agriculture Crops
</h2>
<div id="shyam">
	<p>
		The state has three main crop seasons: kharif (or aghani), rabi, and garma (summer). The major kharif crops are rice, millet and maize. The rabi crops are wheat, pulses, gram, and mustard. In the garma, farmers grow rice, maize, groundnuts and vegetables.
		Pulses are non-traditional crops but are fast emerging as important crops in the state, with the area under them doubling from 2009-10 to 2012-13 to reach about 600,000 hectares. Together with partners like the Jharkhand Tribal Development Society (JTDS) and Birsa Agricultural University (BAU), ICRISAT research is promoting farmer-preferred improved chickpea varieties to raise average yields from the current low of 830kg/ha and help design resilient productive cropping systems.</p>

Improved crop production technologies for chickpea and oilseed crops are being promoted in rainfed rice fallow lands where farmers used to grow nothing after the paddy harvest. Chickpea and other crops like field pea, linseed, or mustard can now use the remaining soil moisture. Since there is a thriving market for these foodgrains, farmers are quickly adopting these new crops.
	</p>
<h3>Some of the important  crops that are grown in abundance in the state are</h3>
<ul>
<li>rice-The average production of rice is around 14.8 lakh/hec each year. </li>
<li>wheat-The average annual wheat production is approximately 2123kg/hact</li>
<li>maize-Maize is also cultivated, with an average annual production level of approximately 2093kg/hact.</li>
<li>pulses-The state had produced 1020kg/hact of mango annually</li>
<li>mangoes-The state had produced 1014kg/hact of litchi annually</li>
</ul>
Pulses such as moong, arhar, peas, and khesari are grown, more in southern than in northern Bihar. The leading districts are Patna, Bhojpur, Aurangabad, and Nalanda. Sugar cane and jute are two other major cash crops of Bihar.</p>

	soil and vegetation in Jharkhand
</h2>
<div id="shyam">
<p>
	The cultivated area of the state is about 1.8 million ha, comprising 22% of the geographical area. The net irrigated area is about 0.16 million ha, constituting 9.3% of the cultivated area. Being largely rainfed, the state has a cropping intensity of 126%. For higher agriculture production, major constraints of the state are sloping lands with hard rock areas, severe soil erosion, water scarcity, acidic soils, low soil fertility, low input use of agricultural inputs and open grazing in rabi season.</p>

<p>
Soil content of Jharkhand state mainly consist of soil formed from disintegration of rocks and stones, and soil composition is further divided into:
<ul>

<li><h3>Red soil</h3>It is  found mostly in the Damodar valley, and Rajmahal area</li>
<li><h3>Micacious soil</h3> It is found in Koderma, Jhumri Telaiya, Barkagaon, and areas around the Mandar hil
Sandy soil, generally found in Hazaribagh and Dhanbad</li>
<li><h3>Black soil</h3>It is  found in Rajmahal area</li>
<li><h3>Laterite soil</h3>It is found in western part of Ranchi, Palamu, and parts of Santhal Parganas and Singhbhum.</li>

 <h2>Jharkhand Climate</h2>
 <div id="shyam">
 	<p>Climate of Jharkhand varies from Humid subtropical in the north to tropical wet and dry in the south-east.[47] The main seasons are summer, rainy, autumn, winter and spring. The summer lasts from mid-April to mid-June. May, the hottest month, characterized by daily high temperatures around 38 °C(100 °F) and low temperatures around 25 °C (77 °F). The southwest monsoon, from mid-June to October, brings nearly all the state's annual rainfall, which ranges from about 40 inches (1,000 mm) in the west-central part of the state to more than 60 inches (1,500 mm) in the southwest.</p>

 	 Nearly half of the annual precipitation falls in July and August.The winter season lasts from November to February. The temperatures in Ranchi in December usually vary from about 10 °C (50 °F) to around 24 °C (75 °F). Spring season lasts from mid-February to mid-April.[48]</p>
