            Disesases Found In Major Crops In India
        </h1><hr>
    <h2>
        1:Diseases In Wheat
    </h2>
    <p>In India, during summer season, high temperatures do not allow either the wheat crop or the rust to survive in the plain areas. Climatic conditions are favourable for the wheat rust to survive in the Himalayan region during summer season on the host plant of Barberry. Weather conditions are favourable for the survival of wheat rust in central Nepal, which acts as a source region for the wheat rust.</p>

     <p>Later on during winter season, when wheat crop is grown in the plains of north India, rust has the tendency to migrate from the Nepal hills to plains of north India. Similarly, Nilgiri hills in south India are the source region of wheat rust, where wheat is cultivated throughout the year. Wheat rust can move from Nilgiri hills towards north in central India.</p>

<h2>Wheat rust can be divided into three types:</h2>
<p>
    i. Yellow rust.
</p>
<p>
    ii. Brown rust.
</p>
<p>
    iii. Black rust.

    <h3>i. Blast Diseases Of Rice</h3>
         <h3 style="color: rgba(0,0,0,0.5)">The weather conditions favourable for the incidence of disease are given below:</h3>
         <p>
         i. Minimum temperature should be less than 26°C    
         </p>
         <p>
            ii. Relative humidity should be more than 90 per cent.
         </p>
         <p>
            If these conditions prevail during the period of seedling, tillering and ear emergence, then the disease is likely to appear. Severity of the disease is likely to increase if the minimum temperature remains below 23°C with relative humidity more than 90 per cent for many days.
         </p>


<h3>ii.  Stem Rot Of Rice</h3>
         <h3 style="color: rgba(0,0,0,0.5)">The weather conditions favourable for the incidence of disease are given below:</h3>
         <p>
         i. Temperature should range between 19-37°C during summer season and 17-26°C during winter season  
         </p>
         <p>
            ii.High relative humidity should persist
         </p>
         <p>
            iii. Rice crop grown under irrigated conditions is more susceptible to this disease.
         </p>

<h3>iii.  Bacterial Leaf Blight: </h3>
         <h3 style="color: rgba(0,0,0,0.5)">The weather conditions favourable for the incidence of disease are given below:</h3>
         <p>
         i. Temperature should range between 30.4 – 32.7°C.
         </p>
         <p>
            ii.Relative humidity should range between 86 – 93 per cent.
         </p>
         <p>
            iii. Sunshine hours should range between 3.3 – 7.8 hours per day.

<h2>
        3:Diseases In Groundnut
    </h2>

    <h3>i. Leaf Spot:</h3>
         <p>
         It is an important disease of groundnut. Leaf spot may be of two types. Early leaf spot and late leaf spot. These diseases are found all over the world, where the groundnut is cultivated. This disease is more common in those areas, where groundnut-groundnut cropping system is existing.

Early leaf spot can appear after a few weeks of sowing. It appears earlier than the late leaf spot. Generally these diseases can damage the crop by 10 – 15 per cent. However, if the severity of the disease is high, then crop may suffer 50 per cent damage  
         </p>



<p>
    It has been observed that primary source of infection is the plant residue left in the fields. Leaf wetness is also one of the causes of these diseases. Dew, fog and rainfall are important sources of moisture, which keep the leaves wet. The magnitude of the incidence of the disease depends upon the duration of wetness.

Higher the duration of wetness, higher is the infection. The severity of the leaf spot is higher in kharif season than in rabi and summer season. Losses may be more in those areas where the crop is grown under irrigated conditions because of higher humidity.
</p>
<h3 style="color: rgba(0,0,0,0.5)">The weather conditions favourable for the incidence of disease are given below:</h3>
         <p>
         i.  Temperature should range between 22-35°C.
         </p>
         <p>
            ii.Humid conditions caused by excessive rainfall should persist.         </p>
         <p>
            iii. Higher duration of leaf wetness due to dew, fog and rainfall.
         </p>

<h3>ii. Groundnut Rust:</h3>
         <p>
         This disease may appear at any phenological stage of the crop. The development of the disease depends upon the infection, which is influenced by temperature conditions, leaf wetness and high humidity.   
         </p>




<h3 style="color: rgba(0,0,0,0.5)">The weather conditions favourable for the incidence of disease are given below:</h3>
         <p>
         i.  Temperature should be around 24°C. 
         </p>
         <p>
            ii.Mean relative humidity should be around 87 per cent.
             </p>
         <p>
            iii. There should be intermittent rainfall.
         </p>

        4:Diseases In Pulses

    <h3>i. Ascochyta Blight of Chickpea:</h3>

    <h3 style="color: rgba(0,0,0,0.5)">The weather conditions favourable for the incidence of disease are given below:</h3>
         <p>
         i.  Temperature should be around 20-25°C. 
         </p>
         <p>
            ii.There should be high and prolonged rainfall.
             </p>
         <p>
            iii.There should be intermittent cloudiness and dew.
         </p>

         <p>
            Jhorar (1997) found that fall in maximum temperature and rise in afternoon relative humidity in the month of March accelerates the disease development. Based on these parameters, humid thermal ratio (HTR) was developed for use in the disease prediction model. According to this model, when HTR falls between 1.3 and 3.2, then the outbreak of the blight can be expected.
         </p>
         
    <h3>ii.Lentil Rust:</h3>        
    <p>
        This disease appears at flowering and podding stage in the form of Pycinia and Aecia. Aeciospores germinate at 17-22°C and infect other plants forming either secondary Aecia or Uredia depending upon prevalent temperature of 25°C.


    </p>
    <h3>iii. Mungbean Yellow Mosaic:</h3>
    <p>
    White fly population and incidence of yellow mosaic on mungbean are high in crop sown during July in India. Maximum temperature is positively correlated with the population in 20- 30 day old crop and with the disease incidence in 45 day old crop.

Multiple regression indicated that maximum temperature alone is important in predicting the disease outbreak. Per cent transmission was reduced and the incubation period in mungbean plants was extended in November-December compared with July-October.

    <h3>
        Late Blight Of Potato:
    </h3>

        <p>
         During winter season, western disturbances cause cloudiness, rains, dew and fog over North India. When these weather parameters become favourable, late blight of potato appears. But during summer season, favourable weather conditions are found in the hilly areas of north India. Therefore, incidence of late blight of potato is common in hilly regions.   
        </p>
        <h4 style="color: rgba(0,0,0,0.5)"> 
            Forecast of Late Blight of Potato:
        </h4>
        <p>
        Several studies have been conducted to predict late blight of potato by using various environmental conditions. Late blight of potato could be predicted by using synoptic charts and warnings were issued four days ahead for spraying the potato crop against late blight.
