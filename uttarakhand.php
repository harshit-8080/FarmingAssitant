    <h1>Overview</h1>
    <p>
      Uttarakhand being a hill state offers great opportunity in agriculture and animal husbandry, about 75% of the people living in Uttarakhand are dependent on agriculture for their livelihood. While those residing in the vulnerable parts are untouched by modernization so they lack knowledge about the new agricultural techniques which results in less produce. However, educating the agro-based communities about hybrid seeds, machinery, bio-techniques, organic farming, haphazard of insecticides and pesticides etc. can help them in raising their productivity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most of the area of State is under forests and wastelands thus leaving only a small amount of land i.e. 7.41lakh ha (about 14%) (LUS 2009-10)  for cultivation out of the total reported area of 56.72 lakh ha.
    </p>
    <p>
      Out of the total, about 89% are under small and sub marginal. As large number and area is under small and marginal holdings, scale of economies cannot be availed of, and so the input cost per unit of output is higher. The soil of tarai region is very fertile and support to number of crops. Indiscriminate use of chemicals and overexploitation of groundwater makes the soil of this region less fertile, causing the reduction in the sustainability in productivity. On the other hand the hill region is prone to constant soil erosion due to steep slopes making it less and less fertile, which could be achieved through adoption of better management practices.

    <h1>Organic Farming In Uttarakhand</h1>
    <p>
      The Uttarakhand government would develop nearly 10,000 organic clusters in the mountain region even as a move “is on” to legalise organic farming.
      The Centre has agreed in principle to allocate a budget of Rs 1500 crore to develop 10,000 organic clusters in the state. It is one of several steps initiated by the Centre to realise Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision to develop Uttarakhand as an organic state so that local farmers’ income could be doubled by 2022.

    <p>
      Besides, the state government would soon introduce a project under which an Integrated Model of Agriculture Village would be developed. Under that project, each cluster would be equipped with facilities such as cold storage and sorting-grading units etc.

    <h1>Major Crops</h1>
    <p>
     Like most of India, agriculture is one of the most significant sectors of the economy of Uttarakhand. Basmati rice, wheat, soybeans, groundnuts, coarse cereals, pulses, and oil seeds are the most widely grown crops.  
    </p>
    <h2 style="color: blue">Rice</h2>
    <p>
      The state has 0.3 million ha under rice cultivation which covers irrigated and rainfed hill rice areas. The current state average productivity is about 2 tonnes/ha and the major constraints in production are unsustainable intensive rice-wheat production systems in tarai areas, decreasing organic carbon content in soils, imbalanced fertilizer use, biotic stresses due to weeds, bacterial leaf blight, stem borer (tarai) and blast (hill area).
    </p>
    <h2 style="color: blue">Wheat</h2>
    <p>
      Uttarakhand consists of hilly tracts as well as tarai areas where wheat is an important crop during rabi. It has a contribution of 1.51% towards national production from 1.07 % of wheat-growing area of the country with a productivity of 1.9 tonnes/ha. This is due to the fact that wheat in hills is mainly rainfed as compared to irrigated crop in the tarai. The total area under wheat is 0.4 million ha, with a total production of 0.8 tonnes and productivity of 1.9 tonnes/ha, over the last five years. The constraints are water scarcity in hills and Tarai areas, low soil organic carbon status, high nutrient mining, imbalanced fertilization, and infestation of powdery mildew and Karnal bunt diseases.

    <h1>Region Wise Variation</h1>
    
    <p>
       The growth of foodgrain production is quite variable in different areas. As a result, agriculture scenario presents a mixed picture. (Area Production and Productivity 2010-11) Productivity of district Udham Singh Nagar, Haridwar, Nainital (plain) and Dehradun (plain) is very high, on the other side; productivity of the hilly area is very low, although the valleys are fertile. Plains and hill agriculture stand in stark contrast to each other. While productivity in plains can be compared with agriculturally developed regions of the country, productivity in hill lags far behind. The Green Revolution had highly benefitted the farming system of the plain area of the State while it has neglected the hilly region.
    </p>

  <div id="ram">
    <h1>Irrigation</h1>
    <p>
       In the state, farmers adopt generally two types of agricultural practices i.e. the rainfed and the irrigated. Most of the agriculture in the state is rainfed. The net irrigated area of the state stands at 3.38 lakh hectares (2009-2010). The net irrigated area to net sown area for the state is 45 percent. Being large area under hills, irrigation is available mostly in the plains and valleys. So there is a need to generate alternate sources of irrigation to increase the net irrigated area, which in turn shall also increase the cropping intensity of the state. These alternative sources can be rainwater harvesting, check dams, hydram for lift irrigation etc. Technologies like drip irrigation, sprinklers etc. can also be used for better water management.
